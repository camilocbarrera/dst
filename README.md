# DAG Sketch Tool ðŸŽ¨ (WIPðŸ‘·)

DAG Sketch Tool (DST) helps you create and design Apache Airflow DAGs visually and programmatically. You can use an easy-to-understand markup language and a handy command-line tool called dst for generating DAGs skeletons.

## Try it out

You can test the interactive UI of DAG Sketch Tool at [https://www.dag-sketch.com/](https://www.dag-sketch.com/). This web-based interface allows you to experiment with the visual DAG designer and get a feel for how the tool works.


## Introduction

DAG Sketch Tool (DST) simplifies the creation and management of Apache Airflow DAGs by allowing you to:

- Define DAGs using a human-readable markup language called DAGML (DAG Markup Language) in a YAML-based format.
- Visually design and sketch DAGs using an intuitive UI.
- Generate Airflow DAGs programmatically from DAGML definitions with the dst CLI tool.

## Features

- Simple DAG Definition: Use DAGML to define DAGs in a concise YAML format.
- Visual DAG Designer: Sketch and visualize your DAGs with an interactive UI.
- Powerful CLI: Manage, compile, and validate DAGs using the dst command-line tool.
